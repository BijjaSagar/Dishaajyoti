# Notifications Implementation Summary

## Overview

Task 24 (Notifications setup) has been successfully implemented. The application now has full Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) integration with notification history, badge counts, and navigation handling.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Firebase Cloud Messaging Integration

**Files Created/Modified:**
- `pubspec.yaml` - Added `firebase_core` and `firebase_messaging` dependencies
- `lib/main.dart` - Initialized Firebase and set up background message handler
- `android/build.gradle` - Added Google Services plugin
- `android/app/build.gradle` - Added Firebase dependencies and plugin
- `android/app/google-services.json` - Placeholder Firebase configuration (needs real values)
- `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` - Added FCM permissions and service

- Foreground message handling
- Background message handling
- Notification tap handling
- Local notification history storage (up to 100 notifications)
- Unread count management

### 4. Notification Provider

**File:** `lib/providers/notification_provider.dart`

Features:
- State management for notifications
- Unread count tracking
- Notification list management
- Integration with NotificationService
- Reactive updates using ChangeNotifier

### 5. Notifications Screen

**File:** `lib/screens/notifications_screen.dart`

Features:
- Display notification history
- Pull-to-refresh functionality
- Empty state UI
- Notification cards with:
  - Type-specific icons and colors
  - Read/unread visual indicators
  - Timestamp formatting (relative time)
  - Tap handling for navigation

- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions

### 6. Dashboard Integration

**File:** `lib/screens/dashboard_screen.dart`

Features:
- Notification badge on app bar
- Dynamic unread count display (shows "99+" for counts over 99)
- Navigation to notifications screen
- Auto-refresh unread count when returning from notifications

### 7. Routing

**File:** `lib/routes/app_routes.dart`

Features:
- Added `/notifications` route
- Navigation helper methods

### 8. Documentation

**Files Created:**
- `FIREBASE_SETUP.md` - Complete Firebase setup guide
- `NOTIFICATIONS_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - This file

## How It Works

### Notification Flow

1. **Foreground (App Open)**
   - FCM receives notification
   - Notification saved to local history
   - Unread count incremented
   - No system notification shown (handled by app)

2. **Background (App Minimized)**
   - System shows notification
   - User taps notification
   - App opens and marks notification as read
   - Unread count decremented

3. **Terminated (App Closed)**
   - System shows notification
   - User taps notification
   - App launches and marks notification as read
   - Unread count decremented

### Notification Types and Navigation

When a user taps a notification, the app can navigate based on the data payload:

```json
{
  "notification": {
    "title": "Your Report is Ready!",
    "body": "Your palmistry report has been generated."
  },
  "data": {
    "type": "reportReady",
    "reportId": "report123"
  }
}
```

- If `reportId` is present → Navigate to report detail screen
- If `serviceId` is present → Navigate to service detail screen
- Otherwise → Open notifications screen

## Setup Required

### Before Running the App

1. **Create Firebase Project**
   - Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)
   - Create a new project or use existing one

2. **Android Setup**
   - Register Android app with package name: `com.dishaajyoti.app`
   - Download `google-services.json`
   - Replace `android/app/google-services.json` with downloaded file

3. **iOS Setup**
   - Register iOS app with bundle ID: `com.dishaajyoti.app`
   - Download `GoogleService-Info.plist`
   - Add to Xcode project at `ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist`
   - Enable Push Notifications capability in Xcode
   - Enable Background Modes > Remote notifications in Xcode

4. **Backend Integration**
   - Get Firebase Server Key from Firebase Console
   - Implement notification sending in backend
   - Store FCM tokens in database
   - Send notifications via FCM API

See `FIREBASE_SETUP.md` for detailed setup instructions.

## Testing

### Manual Testing

1. **Run the app:**
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

2. **Get FCM Token:**
   - Check console output for: `FCM Token: <token>`
   - Copy the token

3. **Send Test Notification:**
   - Go to Firebase Console > Cloud Messaging
   - Click "Send your first message"
   - Enter title and body
   - Click "Send test message"
   - Paste FCM token
   - Click "Test"

4. **Test Different States:**
   - Foreground: Keep app open and send notification
   - Background: Minimize app and send notification
   - Terminated: Close app and send notification

5. **Test Notification Types:**
   - Send notifications with different `type` values in data payload
   - Verify correct icons and colors are displayed

### Automated Testing

The notification functionality can be tested with unit tests:

```dart
// Example test structure
test('NotificationModel serialization', () {
  final notification = NotificationModel(
    id: '1',
    title: 'Test',
    body: 'Test body',
    createdAt: DateTime.now(),
    type: NotificationType.general,
  );
  
  final json = notification.toJson();
  final decoded = NotificationModel.fromJson(json);
  
  expect(decoded.title, notification.title);
});
```
