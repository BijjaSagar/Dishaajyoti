# Testing Mode Configuration

## Overview
Testing mode is now enabled to allow free access to all services for testing purposes.

## What Changed

### 1. Service Model (`lib/models/service_model.dart`)
Added testing mode flag and helper properties:
```dart
static const bool testingMode = true; // Set to false for production
bool get isFree => testingMode || price == 0;
String get displayPrice => testingMode ? 'Free (Testing)' : ...;
```

### 2. Dashboard Navigation (`lib/screens/dashboard_screen.dart`)
Updated `_handleServiceSelection` to bypass payment in testing mode:
- All services now navigate directly to their respective screens
- No payment required when `testingMode = true`
- Shows "Coming soon" messages for services not yet implemented

### 3. Service Card (`lib/widgets/cards/service_card.dart`)
Updated to use `service.isFree` property instead of checking `price == 0`

## Current Service Status

âœ… **Working Services:**
- Free Kundali (ID: 0) - Fully functional with chart generation
- AI Kundali Analysis (ID: 1) - Same as Free Kundali for now

ðŸš§ **Coming Soon:**
- Palmistry Reading (ID: 2)
- Numerology Report (ID: 3)
- Marriage Compatibility (ID: 4)

## How to Test

1. **Launch the app**
2. **All services show "FREE" badge** in testing mode
3. **Click any service** - no payment required
4. **For Kundali services:**
   - Fill in birth details
   - Select chart style (North/South Indian)
   - Generate instantly
   - View in list with chart thumbnail
   - Tap to see full chart details

## Switching to Production Mode

When ready for production, change in `lib/models/service_model.dart`:
```dart
static const bool testingMode = false; // Disable testing mode
```

This will:
- Show actual prices on service cards
- Require payment for paid services
- Navigate to OrderConfirmationScreen for paid services

## Kundali Generation Features

âœ… **Implemented:**
- Custom chart rendering (North & South Indian styles)
- Local SQLite storage
- Chart thumbnails in list
- Interactive chart details
- Share functionality
- PDF generation
- Offline-first architecture

ðŸ”§ **Sync Manager:**
- Temporarily disabled due to connectivity_plus API changes
- Kundalis save locally and work perfectly offline
- Can be re-enabled after fixing connectivity API

## Notes

- All services are currently set to `price: 0` in the mock data for testing
- The testing mode flag provides an additional layer of control
- Kundali generation works completely offline
- Charts are stored in local SQLite database
