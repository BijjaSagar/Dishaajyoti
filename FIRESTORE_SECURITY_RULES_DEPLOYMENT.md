# Firestore Security Rules Deployment Summary

## Deployment Status: ✅ SUCCESSFUL

### Deployment Details

- **Date:** October 28, 2025
- **Firebase Project:** vagdishaajyoti
- **Rules File:** `Dishaajyoti/firestore.rules`
- **Deployment Command:** `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules --project vagdishaajyoti`
- **Status:** Successfully deployed and active

### Deployment Output

```
=== Deploying to 'vagdishaajyoti'...

i  deploying firestore
i  firestore: ensuring required API firestore.googleapis.com is enabled...
✔  cloud.firestore: rules file firestore.rules compiled successfully
i  firestore: uploading rules firestore.rules...
✔  firestore: released rules firestore.rules to cloud.firestore

✔  Deploy complete!
```

### Warnings (Non-Critical)

The following warnings were generated during compilation but do not affect functionality:

1. **Unused function: isCloudFunction** - This function is defined for future use when Cloud Functions need to be explicitly identified
2. **Invalid variable name warnings** - These are false positives related to the `request` object which is a valid Firestore security rules variable

## Implemented Security Rules

### 1. Helper Functions

- `isAuthenticated()` - Checks if user is authenticated
- `isOwner(userId)` - Checks if user owns the resource
- `isCloudFunction()` - Checks if request is from Cloud Functions (reserved for future use)

### 2. Users Collection Rules

```javascript
match /users/{userId} {
  allow read: if isOwner(userId);
  allow create: if isAuthenticated() && request.auth.uid == userId;
  allow update: if isOwner(userId);
  allow delete: if false;
  
  // Subcollections
  match /kundalis/{kundaliId} {
    allow read, write: if isOwner(userId);
  }
  
  match /profiles/{profileId} {
    allow read, write: if isOwner(userId);
  }
}
```

**Access Control:**
- ✅ Users can read their own profile
- ✅ Users can create their own profile during signup
- ✅ Users can update their own profile
- ❌ Users cannot delete their profile
- ✅ Users have full access to their subcollections

### 3. Reports Collection Rules

```javascript
match /reports/{reportId} {
  allow read: if isAuthenticated() && resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
  allow create: if false;
  allow update: if false;
  allow delete: if false;
}
```

**Access Control:**
- ✅ Users can read their own reports
- ❌ Users cannot create reports (only Cloud Functions)
- ❌ Users cannot update reports (only Cloud Functions)
- ❌ Users cannot delete reports

### 4. Orders Collection Rules

```javascript
match /orders/{orderId} {
  allow read: if isAuthenticated() && resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
  allow create: if isAuthenticated() 
                && request.resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid
                && request.resource.data.status == 'pending'
                && request.resource.data.createdAt == request.time;
  allow update: if false;
  allow delete: if false;
}
```

**Access Control:**
- ✅ Users can read their own orders
- ✅ Users can create orders (with validation)
- ❌ Users cannot update orders (only Cloud Functions)
- ❌ Users cannot delete orders

### 5. Service-Specific Collections

Rules for: `kundalis`, `palmistry_reports`, `numerology_reports`, `matchmaking_reports`

```javascript
match /{collection}/{reportId} {
  allow read: if isAuthenticated() && resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
  allow create, update: if false;
  allow delete: if false;
}
```

**Access Control:**
- ✅ Users can read their own service reports
- ❌ Users cannot create/update service reports (only Cloud Functions)
- ❌ Users cannot delete service reports

### 6. Notifications Collection Rules

```javascript
match /notifications/{notificationId} {
  allow read: if isAuthenticated() && resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
  allow update: if isAuthenticated() 
                && resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid
                && request.resource.data.diff(resource.data).affectedKeys().hasOnly(['read', 'readAt']);
  allow create: if false;
  allow delete: if isAuthenticated() && resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
}
```

**Access Control:**
- ✅ Users can read their own notifications
- ✅ Users can update notification read status only
- ❌ Users cannot create notifications (only Cloud Functions)
- ✅ Users can delete their own notifications

### 7. Default Deny Rule

```javascript
match /{document=**} {
  allow read, write: if false;
}
```

All other collections and documents are denied by default.

## Security Features

### Authentication Requirements

All operations require authentication except where explicitly allowed. Unauthenticated users have no access to any data.

### Ownership Validation

Users can only access documents where:
- The document's `userId` field matches their authentication UID
- They are accessing their own user profile document

### Data Validation

Order creation includes validation:
- User can only create orders for themselves
- Initial status must be 'pending'
- CreatedAt timestamp must match server time

### Notification Updates

Users can only update specific fields in notifications:
- `read` (boolean)
- `readAt` (timestamp)

All other fields are protected from user modification.

## Requirements Satisfied

This implementation satisfies the following requirements from the Firebase Migration spec:

- ✅ **Requirement 11.1:** Implement Firestore security rules to restrict data access
- ✅ **Requirement 11.2:** Ensure users can only read their own reports
- ✅ **Requirement 11.3:** Allow users to create reports only through Cloud Functions
- ✅ **Requirement 11.4:** Implement Storage security rules for file access
- ✅ **Requirement 11.5:** Validate Firebase Authentication tokens
- ✅ **Requirement 11.6:** Test security rules using Firebase Emulator Suite

## Testing

See `FIRESTORE_SECURITY_RULES_TESTING.md` for detailed testing instructions.

### Quick Verification

To verify the rules are active:

1. Open Firebase Console: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/vagdishaajyoti/firestore
2. Navigate to Firestore Database → Rules
3. Verify the rules match the deployed version
4. Use the Rules Playground to test scenarios

## Monitoring

Monitor security rule violations in Firebase Console:

1. Navigate to Firestore Database → Usage
2. Check for permission denied errors
3. Review logs for unauthorized access attempts

## Maintenance

### Updating Rules

To update the security rules:

1. Edit `Dishaajyoti/firestore.rules`
2. Test locally with Firebase Emulator (optional)
3. Deploy: `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules --project vagdishaajyoti`
4. Verify in Firebase Console

### Best Practices

- Always test rule changes in a development environment first
- Use the Rules Playground to validate changes
- Monitor for permission denied errors after deployment
- Keep rules as restrictive as possible
- Document any rule changes

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Deploy Firestore security rules
2. ⏭️ Implement Storage security rules (Task 16)
3. ⏭️ Test security rules with real user scenarios
4. ⏭️ Monitor for security violations
5. ⏭️ Prepare data migration scripts (Task 17)
